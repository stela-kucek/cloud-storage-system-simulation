# Cloud Storage System Simulation

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of a distributed storage access structure, namely a hash-based structure (also utilized in, e.g., [Amazon's DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)) for storing key-value pairs.

The application encompasses the following:
* Permanent storage of key-value pairs
* A dictionary-based data access API
* A client application using the data access API
